# Downloading Photos and Other Verification Process Related Data 

During some verification processes the system collects some additional information that is used for verification.
A good example of this is the document photos, which is used to retrieve the user's first and last name from them.

Additional information is not available in the conversation data, but it is possible to download them via API as the 
so-called conversation metadata.

The API methods used for this purpose are described in the following documents:

- [Downloading additional conversation data](api/GET_conversations_ID_identity_metadata.md)
- [Downloading conversion data files](api/GET_conversations_ID_identity_metadata_media_ID.md)
