# Verification Strategies

Strategies allow you to select an appropriate user verification method and to combine several methods into one process.
The strategies operate on many methods, which come down to the following categories:

- Methods based on *logging in to the user's bank*, when the account owner data is retrieved
- Methods related to *the verification transfer*, when the data of the transfer sender is retrieved
- Methods based on *eDocuments*, when the data of the owner of a given document with a digital layer are retrieved
- Methods based on *taking a photo of the physical document and a photo of the face* of the person showing the evidence
- Other methods, e.g. verification of a telephone number, email or checking data in appropriate databases

For the purposes of creating integration, the most convenient strategy is [public:sandbox](strategies/public-sandbox.md).
You will receive a list of the strategies available to you from Authologic in the implementation process, after identifying your needs.
