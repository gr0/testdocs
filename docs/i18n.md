# Translation and International Service

Authologic supports the possibility of translating the user interface into other languages. 
The individual components are described below

## API support
Both the basic API and the API related to the `White Label` option allow you to specify the language in which the 
messages should be handled. The language is determined on the basis of the HTTP header, e.g.:

<!--
title: "Sample header forcing English"
-->
```html
Accept-Language: en
```

## Identity verification process

Language at pages of the identity verification process is based on the user's preferences defined by browser language. It is possible to force a different language by modifying the URL to which the user is redirected after creating the conversation. The change consists in adding the `lang` parameter.

<!--
title: "Sample URL forcing English"
-->
```html
https://id.sandbox.authologic.com/c/00c11274-607b-408a-ad8e-de95b88bb5fa?lang=en
```
