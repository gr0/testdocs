## Creating a Conversation

In order to retrieve information about the user's presence on the AML lists, a conversation must be created. 
Compared to the information contained in [Integration in 5 minutes](5minutesTutorial.md), we need to define an 
additional product for which we are asking: `aml`. It is also necessary to specify which lists should be checked 
and provide the data that should be checked. Example:

```shell
curl -X POST -u my_login "https://sandbox.authologic.com/api/conversations" \
-H "accept: application/vnd.authologic.v1.1+json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/vnd.authologic.v1.1+json" \
-d '{
    "userKey": "7dfb9ded-c38f-49ae-95e2-307283a0b1f6",
    "returnUrl": "https://authologic.com/tests/return/?conversation={conversationId}",
    "query": {
        "identity": {
            "requireOneOf": [
                [ "PERSON_NAME_FIRSTNAME", "PERSON_NAME_LASTNAME"]
            ]
        },
        "aml": {
            "checks": ["PEP", "SANCTIONS", "ADVERSE_MEDIA", "SIP"]
        }
    },
    "hints": {
        "known": {
            "person": {
                "name": {
                    "firstName": "Jan",
                    "lastName": "Kowalski"
                },
                "info": {
                    "birthDate": "1964-05-11"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}'
```

In the example above, we have set conversation to check the following lists:

- `PEP` - List of persons in politically exposed positions
- `SANCTIONS` - List of individuals for whom sanctions have been implemented
- `SIP` - List of individuals with high risk, typically involved in criminal activities or suspicious activity has been found in the past. May have been involved in court proceedings, had previous criminal allegations, or been involved in financial crimes such as money laundering and terrorist financing.
- `ADVERSE_MEDIA` - List of publications related to a person.

A conversation defined in this way, in response to a query about its status, immediately returns the result, without the 
need for interaction with the user. The result will also be sent using the `callback` mechanism. Example:

```json
{
    "id": "c12c1adc-3ff0-4d32-b95c-c593135c903e",
    "userKey":"7dfb9ded-c38f-49ae-95e2-307283a0b1f6",
    "url":"https://sandbox.authologic.com/c/c12c1adc-3ff0-4d32-b95c-c593135c903e",
    "status": "FINISHED",
    "result": {
        "identity": {
            "status": "FINISHED",
            "user": {
                "person": {
                    "name": {
                        "firstName": "Maria",
                        "lastName": "Sochacka"
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        "aml": {
            "status": "FINISHED",
            "found": ["PEP", "SANCTIONS", "ADVERSE_MEDIA", "SIP"]
        }
    }
}
```

Information: `status` acts identically to the `identity` section.

When a conversation is completed, the AML product reports in the `found` field those lists in which the
current user was found. A detailed report can be obtained by using the dedicated API method described
in the next section.

## Downloading detailed information

Having information on which lists the user was found on, it is possible to download a detailed report containing 
the collected information, e.g.:

```shell
curl -u my_login "https://sandbox.authologic.com/api/conversations/c12c1adc-3ff0-4d32-b95c-c593135c903e/aml/PEP" \
-H "accept: application/vnd.authologic.v1.1+json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/vnd.authologic.v1.1+json"
```

Parameterizing the call of the above method with the name of the AML list `PEP`, `SANCTIONS`, `SIP`, `ADVERSE_MEDIA` 
we get the first page of results for a given list.

The response structure varies depending on the selected AML list. A detailed description of the response structure can be found in the 
[AML product details])(api/GET_conversations_ID_aml.md) section.

## Example Test Data

We have prepared test data sets on a `sandbox` environment.

In order to obtain differentiated results, in the field `hints.known.person.name.lastName`, one of the following names should be given:

- `Putin` - "PEP", "SANCTIONS", "SIP", "ADVERSE_MEDIA","OTHER"
- `Shoygu` - "SANCTIONS"
- `Kwa≈õniewski` - "SIP"
- `Biden` - "PEP"
- `Trzaskowski` - "ADVERSE MEDIA"
- `Kowalski` - czysta lista AML

If you enter a name that is not on the list, the data associated with the name `Putin` will appear in the results.

The above data sets are also valid when running the [AML change monitoring functionality](product-aml-subscription.md).
Then, after 2 and 5 minutes after the first data, we simulate changes in the results of AML lists. The related `callback` 
notifications are also sent.
