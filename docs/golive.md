# Production Launch

The best place to safely test the Authologic system capabilities and integrate with your system is the test 
environment https://sandbox.authologic.com/.

At some point, you will want to provide a system to our target users. Contact us, we will copy
your configuration to the production environment. The only things you will need to change are:

- API address: https://sandbox.authologic.com/ changes to: https://api.authologic.com/
- API key
- The signature verification key used by the `callback mechanism`

> #### TIP
> 
> The test environment will stay still available for further tests or changes to your integration.
