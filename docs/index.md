# Documentation

<!-- theme: info -->
> Authologic allows you to execute a simple and effective verification of the user's identity. 
> The use of the API consists of initiating the process by an external system, redirecting the 
> user to the appropriate page, and then receiving the verification results.

## Organization of the Documentation
Documentation is structured to take you from the simpler to the more advanced options.
Our API is also built in such a way that you donâ€™t have to make all the decisions related to integration right away. 
Each element is only a supplement to the previous ones. This allows you to quickly build a basic integration, then add 
new features, products, and enhancements when needed.

## Basic Information
The following information is *necessary* to build a basic, but in most cases sufficient, Authologic integration.

#### [Overview](overview.md) 
Understand communicating with Authologic services and how to verify identity.

#### [Integration in 5 minutes:Basic information](5minutesTutorial.md)
API in practice, which is a description of the basics of integration on the basis of a few commands that can be 
tested from the command line.

#### [Conversation statuses](statuses.md)
Description of the conversation lifecycle, conversation status and individual products.
