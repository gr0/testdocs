# Integration Within the Angular Application

Unfortunately, we do not yet have documentation describing direct integration 
with [Angular](https://angular.dev/). Integration will be based on installing the library:

<!--
title: "Library Installation"
-->
```shell
npm i @authologic/websdk
```

and connecting it in a similar way as in the document described [here](js.md).
