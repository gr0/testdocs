# Customizing User Interface

The pages to which the user is redirected for identity verification can be customized as far as logo and 
colours. Contact us, and we will define together how these pages can look like.

Another, more complex option is the so-called `White Label` option, where you can build the pages on your side. 
We suggest that you first use the previously mentioned option for the beginning as it is simpler and sufficient 
in a large number of cases. Switching to `White Label` option is possible at any time, and it means that the 
redirection to Authologic websites will be replaced with another mechanism. All other integration elements remain 
unchanged.

More about the `White Label` option in [here](whiteLabel.md).
